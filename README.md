# The Backrooms Three.js

A simple backrooms demo i made with grok 3 and cursor with claude.
You can play it from your browser. Heres the link: https://serkali-sudo.github.io/the-backrooms-threejs/

Since there are a lot of point lights for ceiling lights it is a bit gpu intensive even though the game is mostly empty.
I think this can be fixed by replacing ceiling lights with the fake lights then adding like ambient light.
But then it wouldnt look very good because there wouldnt be shadows i guess.
